# Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Begind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems
**Author**: Martin Kleppmann

## Preface
Data-intensive applications are pushing the boundaries of what is possible by making use of the technological developments.


## Part I - Foundations of Data Systems
> Discuss the fundamental ideas that underpin the design of data-intensive application.

### Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
> What are we trying to achieve? Reliability, scalability, and maintainability. How do we need to think about them? How can we achieve them?

### Chapter 2 - Data Models and Query Languages
> Compare several different data models and query languages, see how they are appropriate to different situations.

### Chapter 3 - Storage and Retrieval
> Storage engines: How databases arrange data on disk so that we can find it again efficiently.

### Chapter 4 - Encoding and Evolution
> Formats for data encoding (serialization) and evolution of schemas over time.

## Part II - Distributed Data
> Data distributed across multiple machines. Necessary for scalability, but brings with it a variety of unique challenges.

### Chapter 5 - Replication

### Chapter 6 - Partitioning

### Chapter 7 - Transactions

### Chapter 8 - The Trouble with Distributed Systems

### Chapter 9 - Consistency and Consensus

## Part III - Derived Data
> Discuss systems that derive some datasets from other datasets. Heterogeneous systems: when there is no one database that can do everything well, applications need to integrate several different databases, caches, indexes and so on.

### Chapter 10 - Batch Processing
> Batch processing approach to derived data.

### Chapter 11 - Stream Processing
> Stream processing approach to derived data.

### Chapter 12 - The Future of Data Systems
> Approaches for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications in the future.
