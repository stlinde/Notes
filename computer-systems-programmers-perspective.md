# Computer Systems - A Programmer's Perspective
**Authors**: Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron

### Preface
Aim is to explain the enduring concepts underlying all computer systems, and to show the concrete ways that these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of application programs.

### Chapter 1 - A Tour of Computing Systems
Files that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as text files.
All other files are known as binary files.

The source code for our program `hello.c` is a text file consisting of a sequence of bytes represented by ASCII characters.

All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits.
The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which we view2 them.
